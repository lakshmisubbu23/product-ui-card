# Product UI Card

This project is a **responsive product UI card** design that showcases three different pasta styles. The project was created using **HTML** and **CSS** to demonstrate key web design 
principles such as **selectors**, **box model**, **colors**, **typography**, and **positioning**. The layout is designed to be **responsive**, meaning it adjusts to different screen
sizes, making it suitable for both mobile and desktop views.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure and content of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling, positioning, and responsiveness.
  - **CSS Selectors**: Targeting specific HTML elements for styling.
  - **Box Model**: Managing margins, padding, and content areas.
  - **Typography**: Choosing and styling fonts for a clean design.
  - **Positioning**: Proper alignment of elements to create a neat layout.
